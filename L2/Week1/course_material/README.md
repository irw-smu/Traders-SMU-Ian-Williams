# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

Ian Williams Irwilliams@smu.edu Level 1 (Junior) or Level 2 (Associate) Core- Will be attending some JQ sessions as well.

1. Background in Quantitative Finance
In this section, describe your current background in quantitative finance. This could include:

Relevant coursework or degrees
Previous internships or jobs
Personal projects or research
Trading experience (if any)
What sparked your interest in quant finance

I transferred in from Rhodes College this year, where I took economics, statistics, and business statistics. I completed an internship at Cattlemens's Bank and SAMCO Capital markets, where I did work on credit analysis and Municiple Bond trading respectively. I am also a contracted analyst at a few prop trading firms, all with futures. Most notably, Topstep, AlphaFutures, ApexTraderFunding (until 2024). I run an LLC I file taxes through with realized gains. I use Edgeful LLC, technical analysis, NQ heatmap, and QuantData LLC to form speculative plays on primarily NASDAQ and S&P 500 futures (NQ/ES). MY older brother, Zane, got me into trading options originally, before starting his career at JPM. I really loved the world, the daily grind, and journey trading has taken me on. Since then, Zane is no longer aloud to trade legally due to his work at JPM.

2. Career Goals
In this section, outline your short and long-term career goals. Be specific about:

What roles or positions interest you
Which companies or types of firms you'd like to work for
Specific areas of finance you want to specialize in
What you hope to achieve in 1, 5, and 10 years

I have had a few chats with people in the industry, where small hedgefunds or banks seemed appealing. I am not sure entirely how, but I would love to be involved in trading the financial markets. Equity Trader or something similar would be awesome. I have some experience with JPM and SAMCO, where I could possible be a trader, but am unsure at this time. I like the idea of Sell-Side, but again very up in the air for what I want. In 1 year, I hope to break my goal of 100K realized profit from prop trading by following risk parameters (About 40k additional needed). I also want to further establish my LLC and have Python algorithms running seamlessly. In 5 years, I hope to be specializing in several investment sectors ranging in risk, stocks, options, futures, arb, etc. I hope to be managing my own fund. In 10 years, I hope that fund has taken off, with sizable amount under management. Zane has interest and passion in this sector as well, so I hope to be working with him.

3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program
In this section, describe what specific knowledge, skills, or experiences you hope to gain from the Alpha Program:

Technical skills (programming, math, statistics)
Financial concepts and trading strategies
Specific tools or platforms
Networking opportunities
How this program fits into your overall learning path

I hope to improve my statistical abilities, coding abilities, and network. Specifically, I would love to have money running in an algorithm by EOY, using new and current trading strategies. I hope to increase my knowledge on arbitrauge, and options strategies. I currently use Tradingview, ProjectX, NinjaTrader, and Tradovate. So, I would be able to implement these ideas using those platforms. I hope to meet other people interested in derivatives, specifically Futures, and work with. Possibly work with in the future on that previously mentioned fund.

4. Current Technical Skills
In this section, honestly assess your current technical skills. Rate yourself (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) in:

Programming languages (Python, R, etc.)
Data analysis tools
Statistical analysis
Financial modeling
Machine learning
Version control (Git)
Other relevant skills


I am semi-knowledgeable in R, Python, Java, and Pine script (Tradingview's native language)(Int). Statistics need some refreshing, but should not be long to relearn. (Beg/Int) I am unknowledgable on Fincancial Modeling, and would love to grow there. (Beg) Machine learning is also an area of weakness. (Beg) Some expereince with GitHub, but not extensive (Beg)

5. Development Plan & Program Goals
In this section, outline:

Specific skills you plan to develop during this program
How you will measure your progress
Time commitment you're planning to dedicate each week
Resources you'll use beyond the program materials
Your definition of success for this program


Specifically, I want to be able to code a Python script in NinjaTrader (or something comperable) to run seamless futures trading. I also want to grow in the area of statistics to work out personal trading strategies. I will measure this by learning until I can do it, or building as I learn. I am very dedicated to this world, and already put several hours a week into trading or strategy testing, I want to put in minimum 10 hours a week into this. I plan on attending both L1&2 sessions, as I have already discussed, and want to grow ASAP. Like previously mentioned, I use data platforms, Edgeful and QuantData to trade already, as well as books like Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives to gain knowledge of financial markets. My definition of success is knowledge. Money will come. I mentioned a monetary goal previously, but I am well aware that is a side affect of the things I do outside the charts and data. I will be successful if I can learn Python applications to help me with my work.

I understand that this document will be used to track my progress throughout the program and may be referenced during career counseling sessions. I commit to working toward these goals during the Traders@SMU Alpha Program. -IRW
